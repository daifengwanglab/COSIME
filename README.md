# COSIME: Cooperative multi-view integration and Scalable and Interpretable Model Explainer

Cooperative Multiview Integration and Scalable and Interpretable Model Explainer (COSIME) is a machine learning model that integrates multi-view data for disease phenotype prediction and computes feature importance and interaction scores. By leveraging deep learning-based encoders, COSIME effectively captures the complex, multi-layered interactions between different omic modalities while preserving the unique characteristics of each data type. The integration of LOT techniques aligns and merges heterogeneous datasets, improving the accuracy of modeling cross-modality relationships in the joint latent space. After training a model, COSIME leverages the Shapley-Taylor Interaction Index to compute feature importance and interaction values, allowing for a deeper understanding of how individual features and their interactions contribute to the model's predictions
